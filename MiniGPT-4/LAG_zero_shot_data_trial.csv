The image shows a fundus photograph of the eye, which is a type of retinal imaging used to evaluate the health of the retina and optic nerve.

The optic nerve carries these signals from the eye to the brain.

In this image, there is a visible cupping of the optic nerve head, which is a sign of glaucoma. The cupping occurs when the pressure inside the eye increases, causing the optic nerve to push forward and create a depression in the optic nerve head.
