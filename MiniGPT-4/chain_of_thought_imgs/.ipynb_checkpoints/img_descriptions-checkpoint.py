Right eye (left image) demonstrates marked cupping of the optic nerve. Retinal vessels can be seen 'bayoneting' superonasal (arrow). Left eye (right image) demonstrates greater cupping than the right eye with near complete loss of neuroretinal rim and surrounding peripapillary atrophy. Retinal vessels are seen 'bayoneting' inferotemporal with brief loss of visualization upon entering the cup (arrow). Optic nerve heads are magnified in the lower right corner of each image."],

The normal sheen of the nerve fiber layer is absent in a distribution radiating temporally from this notch due to cellular loss. The notch and nerve fiber layer defect can be more easily visualized on optical coherence tomography."],

Arterioles and venules have normal color, sheen, and course. Background is in normal color. The macula is enclosed by arching temporal vessels. The fovea is located by a central pit."]]
