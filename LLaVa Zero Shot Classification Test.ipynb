    "Cup Shape: The shape of the cup should be observed, as an asymmetric or vertically elongated cup can be an indication of glaucoma.\n",

    "Optic Disc Rim: The appearance of the neuroretinal rim, which surrounds the cup, is assessed. In glaucoma, this rim tends to thin and become pale or grayish.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rim Notching: Notching or notches in the neuroretinal rim, particularly in the inferior and superior regions, can be a characteristic sign of glaucoma.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disc Hemorrhages: Presence of hemorrhages, small bleeding spots, at or around the optic nerve head may indicate glaucomatous damage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nerve Fiber Layer Defects: The doctor will look for thinning or gaps in the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) around the optic nerve head, which is a common early sign of glaucoma.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vascular Changes: Changes in the blood vessels, such as vascular narrowing, crossing defects, or bayoneting, may suggest glaucoma or other optic nerve disorders.\n",
    "\n",
    "Optic Disc Color: The color of the optic nerve head is assessed, and any abnormal discoloration, such as pallor or hyperemia, may raise suspicion of optic nerve damage.\n",
    "Peripapillary Atrophy: Doctors will look for areas of atrophy (thinning) of the retinal pigment epithelium around the optic disc, which can be associated with glaucoma.\n",
    "\n",
    "Optic Nerve Head Excavation: The depth of the optic nerve head excavation or the cup depth is evaluated, as increased cupping can indicate glaucomatous damage.\n",
